If you are using the minima template provide by Jekyll then -

Add google_analytics: UA-xxxxxxxx-x to your _config.yml
Create a file _includes/google-analytics.html and add the google analytics js code in it.
Replace

ga('create', 'UA-xxxxxxxx-x', 'auto');
with

ga('create', '{{ site.google_analytics }}', 'auto');
and you are set!

The google analytics code will now display if your site is built in production environment. For reference see the template's source code here - https://github.com/jekyll/minima

You can follow the same approach if you are using a different template by referencing the template's source code and replacing the corresponding files.
